
v2.0
- ajaxed introduced. the page can render content and be used for each own ajax requests. return() and returnValue() methods
	are used within callbacks to return JSON for the communication between ASP and javascript. when using ajaxed an init() method
	is required within the page. This is called before main() and before callback(). Try to stick to this habbit using init() in your
	pages to initialize security, etc.

v1.0
- clicking on the header shows the error in an alertbox. just for the case that the whole error is not on the screen (for whatever what reason)
- it uses a helper var which is taken from session("GL_lastErrorHelperVar"). so whenever you want to track some helper var
	its recommended to set this var each time before some special error occurs. e.g. getRecordset uses this mechanism.
	helper var can be easily copied from a textarea (usefull when working with modals)
- ErrorHandler is not loaded automatically with the lib.
- it required the texttemplate now because errorMail.html is used to send the mail
- seperated styles and languages
- when buffering is on then just the error is shown because buffer is cleared before. this makes the error always look nice.
- it is used now as the error for all errors when using the 500-100.asp from ERRRORPAGES
- changed the error handler completely
