
v 0.3 (25.09.2006)

- default maxsize is 100KB
- default uploadPath is consts.userFiles
- when using the fileuploader now, you can easily access formfields via lib.RF() 
	instead of uploaderObj.form, etc. page.isPostback() is working as well out-of-the-box now
- allowedExtensions also accepts commaseperation with space
- upload() used to return filename or boolean (false) when not sucessful. now it can just return a string. empty if not successfull.
- fieldname introduced and filename is OBSOLETE now.
- file-property removed because it was unneseccary
- sets the form-object to the library automatically. this allows you to still use the the page.isPostback(), lib.RF, etc.
- some refactoring, restructuring
