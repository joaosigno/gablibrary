VERSION 1.1

March 2008
- all umlaute have been changed to their html entities to fully support UTF-8. there might be some in javascript alert.
	they dont parse the entities correctly and therefore on this places it should be changed into "oe", "ae", etc.
	if you come across something like this then just change it. Applies mainly to the components which are also translated to german
- added dropdownAutosplit property to the drawtables filter class. turning this off will solve problems with ':' in your filters'SQL query
- lib.getScalar uses str.parse now... e.g. it has not treated floats correctly till now
- lib.exec function added. init() sub for ajaxed is only called now if it exists. if does not exist then nothing happens.
	furhtermore you can use the lib.exec yourself if you want to call functions dependent on their existence
- updated to prototype 1.6.0.2 (ajaxed works with it)
- gablib.callback uses all form params if automatically if there is a form called "frm" and no params are given manually.
- rowUp (alt+arrow up), rowDown (alt+arrow down) and copyRow (alt + page down) homesite scripts added.
- str.URL (nicer build of urls) and str.parse (nice one for parsing! - if you expect a given datatype and only this datatype) added
- str.matching added ... a quicker way to evaluate regular expression against a string
- updated to JSON 1.4.1
- customSendMail supports also ASPEmail now. Default is still JMail
- added webservicesHost into the consts again. This is only for backwards compatibility if you are using the 0.3 version of webservice.
	if you have old webservice then just use the old version of webservice and it works fine. must be supported because other
	3rd party clients rely on this form of webservice (e.g. word macros, etc.)

VERSION 1.0

16.03.2007
- the framework supports UTF-8 now which can be set in the gablibraryconfig. by default its turned on but if its turned off the
	system default is used (usually iso-8859-1)
- lib.version returns the version of the gablib installation

02.03.2007
- classes can be registered using lib.registerClass(). lib.require can require a class within a page.
	- debugging console shows the registered classes.
	- ATTENTION: page must be the first file which is included. must be at the TOP!
	- the whole registering thing makes it easier to use classes of the gablibrary. when a developer requires a specific class
		he can use the lib.require method and the client gets an error if it is not available.
- debugging console can interpret validateable instances now. so its easier to debug e.g. page.addDebugVar("frm.validator", frm.validator)

22.01.2007
- some exceptions added to library-class. e.g. empty SQL in getRecordset
- number of database accesses is now shown by default in the debugConsole

15.01.2007
- protected all demos with onlyWebDev, so that no one can access it. security!
