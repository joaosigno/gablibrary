April 2008
- added TestFixture. easy to implement unittests now.. check the test_testFixture.asp for how to use it
- added lib.range method which makes it easier to create array for a given range. e.g. months of the year (1..12)
- added TestFixture.assertHas and TestFixture.assertHasNot - check documentation
- added lib.insert, lib.update, lib.delete - quicker record handling and more readable.
	- e.g. lib.update "user", array("name", "michal"), 10 or with condition lib.update "user", array("deleted", 0), "active = 1 OR deleted = 0"
	- e.g. lib.delete "user", 1
- lib.toggle and lib.count added (database functions)
- gab_library/test/ provides a console for unit testing.
	- tests are of the whole server are displayed
- lib.contains added: checks if a given value is available within a given datastructure
- lib.getRS() and lib.getUnlockedRS() added ... those should be used instead if getRecordset and getUnlockedRecordset. They
	use parameters for the query as well.. those are automatically sql injection safe.
- gablib.callback ... last parameter url: whenever it is given then its used. it used to only use it if the current url ended with a slash
- validateable has an reflect() method now.. cool to use in combination with ajaxed. Just return the whole validateable instance	
- logger.splittingSize can be 0 .. means that the file should never split
- logger default file extension is .log instead of .txt
- added lib.debug which allows you to log debug messages to a logfile called dev.log.
	- you can also colorize debug messages (use cygwin to tail your log and view it colorized)
	- all database functions use lib.debug now so you can easily tail the log file and see whats going on
	- also each page request is being logged now.
- BUGFIX: when using more multiple dropdowns in one page => IDs of the items could be the same and so the labels didnt really work. added a dropdown.uniqueID property to fix this
- stringbuilder wrapper class added. it supports now stringBuilderVB and .net System.IO.StringWriter (which is really fast)
	- stringbuilder is automatically loaded 
	- use stringbuilder.write method if possible. this chooses always the most efficient way for the output
	- all components are using the new stringbuilder now. lib.useStringBuilder has been removed now because not needed anymore
- Drawtable:
	- added columnCommon.cssClass and radioButtonColumn.cssClass. with these attributes its possible now to assign css classes to columns... this didnt work before!
	- column headers are now printed on every page when printing. (if custom stylesheet used then check the drawtables updated print style definition)
	- fullsearchText can be provided through querystring as well now .. this allows us to call a page and prefilter the data with a given term ;)
	
VERSION 1.1

March 2008
- all umlaute have been changed to their html entities to fully support UTF-8. there might be some in javascript alert.
	they dont parse the entities correctly and therefore on this places it should be changed into "oe", "ae", etc.
	if you come across something like this then just change it. Applies mainly to the components which are also translated to german
- added dropdownAutosplit property to the drawtables filter class. turning this off will solve problems with ':' in your filters'SQL query
- lib.getScalar uses str.parse now... e.g. it has not treated floats correctly till now
- lib.exec function added. init() sub for ajaxed is only called now if it exists. if does not exist then nothing happens.
	furhtermore you can use the lib.exec yourself if you want to call functions dependent on their existence
- updated to prototype 1.6.0.2 (ajaxed works with it)
- gablib.callback uses all form params if automatically if there is a form called "frm" and no params are given manually.
- rowUp (alt+arrow up), rowDown (alt+arrow down) and copyRow (alt + page down) homesite scripts added.
- str.URL (nicer build of urls) and str.parse (nice one for parsing! - if you expect a given datatype and only this datatype) added
- str.matching added ... a quicker way to evaluate regular expression against a string
- updated to JSON 1.4.1
- customSendMail supports also ASPEmail now. Default is still JMail
- added webservicesHost into the consts again. This is only for backwards compatibility if you are using the 0.3 version of webservice.
	if you have old webservice then just use the old version of webservice and it works fine. must be supported because other
	3rd party clients rely on this form of webservice (e.g. word macros, etc.)

VERSION 1.0

16.03.2007
- the framework supports UTF-8 now which can be set in the gablibraryconfig. by default its turned on but if its turned off the
	system default is used (usually iso-8859-1)
- lib.version returns the version of the gablib installation

02.03.2007
- classes can be registered using lib.registerClass(). lib.require can require a class within a page.
	- debugging console shows the registered classes.
	- ATTENTION: page must be the first file which is included. must be at the TOP!
	- the whole registering thing makes it easier to use classes of the gablibrary. when a developer requires a specific class
		he can use the lib.require method and the client gets an error if it is not available.
- debugging console can interpret validateable instances now. so its easier to debug e.g. page.addDebugVar("frm.validator", frm.validator)

22.01.2007
- some exceptions added to library-class. e.g. empty SQL in getRecordset
- number of database accesses is now shown by default in the debugConsole

15.01.2007
- protected all demos with onlyWebDev, so that no one can access it. security!

31.10.2006

28.10.2006

- pageHeader.asp and pageFooter.asp are now in the customLib.
	- this makes the page now completely updateable and not custom anymore.
- HTTPHeader is obsolete now but it has been just used for using response.redirect.
	- buffering property introduced. buffering is by default true. reason: 500-100.asp errors.
- "contentsub" property of page removed.
