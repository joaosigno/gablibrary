** INSTALLING THE COM COMPONENT ON A SERVER BEFORE 2008

regsvr32 stringbuilderVB.dll


** INSTALLING THE COM COMPONENT ON A 2008 SERVER 
- dont do it with regsvr!
go to "component services > computers > my computer > COM+ applications > new application" and create a "server application",
after this you can add DLLs to it which are visible to IIS later.
