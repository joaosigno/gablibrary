v 1.2
- a lot of features work in firefox now
- changed the name of the "classlocation" to "DT_CLASSLOCATION" (in config.asp) because it has overwritten the calendar styles
	if the drawtable and the calendar have been used in the same file
- showColumnHeaders, showTitleBar, enableResetFilter properties introduced.
- showFooter-property introduced.
- columnCommon.isFiltered added. this saves time when creating a basic filter for a lot of rows.
	when setting this to true then the column gets an "basic" keyword filter automatically. THANKS TO DAVID!
- fixed bug: when row disabled then the fastdelete button was shown but it should not be!!
- changes the fastdelete sign to a "X" instead of "del"
- cssLocation property added where you can set the location of the styles manually. by default its taken from the config
- const.asp renamed to config.asp
- addUrl is obsolete now! use formURL instead. you can specifiy where the ID will be inserted. formURL example: news.asp?{0}
- defaultStylesheet-property is obsolete now because the style should be set in the const.asp
- fullsearch is by default ON
- when no records are being displayed then a link to reset the filters are displayed.
- DRAWTABLE_CSS_LOCATION in the constants added. now you can specify the location of the stylesheet
	the print.css has been removed and added to the standard.css.
	reformatted the standard.css and removed unnecessary definitions
	added a drawtable.css which will be loaded for every drawtable. there are general definitions which cannot be changed.
- cellspacing = 0 by default instead of 1 (better when scrolling whthin the table)
- language support (just add a new language in languages-folder and change the iclude in the const.asp)
- legend for the table (class_tablelegend)
- tableheaders stay on top. just set the height to a value and they will stay on top.

v 1.1
- onRowCreated-Event added. now its possible e.g. highlight whole row easily or even make a border for them.
- hovereffect runs now independend of the lib.mouseover. it uses a much faster technique and takes the colors from the const.asp
- filterConditionPosition property added which allow the position of the filter condition. for advanced users.
- dataSubmitted() method implemented
- getChangedRows() gets the rows as an array. changed mean when a radio button has been clicked.

- bug fixed: replaced quotes in the excel-display-string with &quot; - not slower

- addToOutput function automatically adds a linebreak after adding.
- hiddenFieldfunction made for better codeview => all hiddenfields replaced with the function
- "autoDelete" member added. you can turn auto-deletion off and handle the delete process yourself
- "isInModal" member added. its helpful to manage things differntly between modal a common page. 
	till now its important for excel-export because it wont work without that.
